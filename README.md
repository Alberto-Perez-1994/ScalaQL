# ScalaQL

## Summary
This library provides a typesafe Scala DSL for generating SQL queries and statements<br>
These statements can then be executed against a Database using the ScalaQL Context, <br>
which uses JDBC for connecting to the Database, or using any other Database connection middleware<br>


By using Scala macros in order to generate the SQL statetements at compile-time,<br>
SQL generation provides a useful abstraction while having no performance <br>
overhead at runtime compared to running a raw SQL statement.

These SQL generation macros also perform validation on the SQL statements,<br>
so the library user can detect and fix several kinds of errors without the need to execute <br>
the statement against the Database. This also means that most SQL syntax errors are guaranteed<br>
to never happen in production code.

The generated SQL statements can embed runtime values and are fully parameterised,<br>
so there is no risk of SQL Injection attacks.

The DSL works in a similar fashion to some other SQL compile-time DSLs available for Scala,<br>
for instance [Quill](https://github.com/getquill/quill),
but it aims to provide a streamlined API, with a focus on simplicity<br>
from the user standpoint, leaving some advanced functionality aside, in order to adapt better<br>
to the most common business use cases, following the convention over configuration motto.<br>

## Usage

In order to use this library, you would need to add it to the dependencies in build.sbt:<br>

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.albertoperez1994" %% "scalaql" % "1.0.0"
```

ScalaQL DSL aim is to reflect as closely as possible the underlying SQL representation,<br>
so the API is very SQL like:

```scala
import com.albertoperez1994.scalaql._

val qry = query[(Person, Address, Telephone)].select {
  case (p, a, t) â‡’ Query(
    Select          (Result (p.name, p.age, a.street, t.number))
    Where           (a.street like "%Baker St%",
                      p.name in names,
                      coalesce (p.isEmployer, false)),
    OrderBy         (desc (p.age)),
    LeftJoin (a)    (a.id === p.addressId),
    LeftJoin (t)    (t.id === p.telephoneId))
  }
```

The DSL is very concise and uses the same operator and functions that the SQL equivalent.<br>
The SQL output for this query would be the following:

```sql
SELECT      p.[name], p.[age], a.[street], t.[number]
FROM        [Person] AS p
LEFT JOIN   [Address] AS a ON a.[id] = p.[addressId]
LEFT JOIN   [Telephone] AS t ON t.[id] = p.[telephoneId]
WHERE       (a.[street] like '%Baker St%') AND
            (p.[name] in (?, ?, ?)) AND
            (coalesce (p.[isEmployer], 0))
ORDER BY    p.[age] desc
```

And the parameters that were used in this query, for the runtime values are:

```scala
{@Application.names -> [John, Mark, Thomas]}
```

The query is generated in a fully typesafe manner. The query input tables must be specified by<br>
case classes that extend the **DbTable** trait and the query result type must be a case class<br>
that extends either the **DbTable** or the **DbResult** traits.<br>
The qry value will be an object of type **SelectStatement[Result]**, in this case.

```scala
// Database Table Models
case class Person (name: String, age: Int, isEmployer: Boolean, addressId: Int, telephoneId: Int)
                    extends DbTable
case class Address (id: Int, street: String) extends DbTable
case class Telephone (id: Int, number: String) extends DbTable


// Query Result Model
case class Result (name: String, age: Int, street: String, telephoneNumber: String) extends DbResult
```

Additionally the SQL Statement API methods ending in **Debug**, can be used in order to generate<br>
a compile time error that will expose the SQL statement at compile time as well as the internal AST,<br>
that was used to generate the SQL:

```scala
QueryClause (
  SelectClause ([Field (p, name), Field (p, age), Field (a, street), Field (t, number)]),
  FromClause ({p -> Person}), [
  LeftJoinClause (Address, a, [
    Operation (===, [Field (a, id), Field (p, addressId)])]),
  LeftJoinClause (Telephone, t, [
    Operation (===, [Field (t, id), Field (p, telephoneId)])])],
  WhereClause ([
    Operation (like, [Field (a, street),
      LiteralVal ("%Baker St%")]),
    Operation (in, [Field (p, name), Identity (?)]),
    Operation (coalesce, [Field (p, isEmployer), LiteralVal (0)])]),
  OrderByClause ([
    Operation (desc, [Field (p, age)])]))
```

The API also exposes **Insert**, **Update** & **Delete** statements, which have a common trait
(**SQLStatefulStament**):

```scala
val stmts = Seq(insert(john),
                insert(johnAddress), update[Person] (p => (Map(p.name -> "Mark",
                                          p.age  -> 50),
                                      Where(p.age >= 10))),
                delete[Address] (a => Where(a.street <> "Baker Street"))
```

These statements will generate the following SQL output:

```sql
INSERT INTO [Person] ([name], [age], [isEmployer], [addressId], [telephoneId])
VALUES      (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

INSERT INTO [Address] ([id], [street])
VALUES      (?, ?)

UPDATE      [Person]
SET         [name] = 'Mark',
            [age] = 50
WHERE       [age] >= 10

DELETE FROM [Address]
WHERE       [street] <> 'Baker Street'
```

The raw SQL and runtime params from any statement can be obtained at runtime by accessing the **sql**<br>
and **params** fields:

```scala
(qry.sql, qry.params)
```

At last, the statements can be run against a Database by using a **ScalaQLContext** instance,<br>
using the appropiate JDBC connection object<br>

```scala
implicit val context = new ScalaQLContext(conn)
context.run(stmts:_*)
val results: Seq[Person] = qry.run()
```
